# reskew

**reskew** is a package of R convenience functions I have bundled together for my own ease of use. They primarily relate to data processing and visualization for Stan models, but content may change over time. This is my first attempt at making an R package, and documentation is a bit sparse at the moment. Function usage may also be rather idiosyncratic. Use with caution! I offer no guarantees!

### Package Installation

You should be able to install the package with the following code: `devtools::install_github("eveskew/reskew")`
